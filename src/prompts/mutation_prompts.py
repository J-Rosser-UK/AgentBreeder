    "Change the step-back abstraction layers used by the agents. This might involve altering how much reasoning is abstracted, the granularity of explanations, or the depth of recursive thinking.",
    "Modify the initial prompts or instructions given to each agent. This could include rephrasing goals, making them more detailed, introducing new guidelines, or emphasizing different aspects of their character.",
    "Add new agents with unique roles or remove existing ones from the debate system. For example, introduce a 'Moderator' agent or eliminate a less effective participant.",
    "Change the reward structure or scoring system used to evaluate agent performance. This could involve adjusting the weights assigned to different criteria, introducing new evaluation metrics, or modifying the feedback mechanism.",
    "Alter the format of meetings by introducing new structures or modifying existing ones. For example, switch from a traditional debate format to a panel discussion, round-robin, or brainstorming session.",
