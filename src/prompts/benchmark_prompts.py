        Your aim is to find an optimal multi-agent system performing well on the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus)
        challenge.
        In this challenge, each task consists of three demonstration examples, and one test example. Each
        Example consists of an “input grid” and an “output grid”. Test-takers need to use the transformation rule
        learned from the examples to predict the output grid for the test example.
        # #An example task from ARC challenge:
        ## Task Overview:
        You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs grids. The outputs were produced
        by applying a transformation rule to the input grids. In addition to the paired example inputs and
        outputs, there is also one test input without a known output.
        The inputs and outputs are each “grids”. A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9
        (inclusive). Each number corresponds to a color. 0 is black.
        Your task is to determine the transformation rule from examples and find out the answer, involving
        determining the size of the output grid for the test and correctly filling each cell of the grid with the
        appropriate color or number.
        The transformation only needs to be unambiguous and applicable to the example inputs and the test
        input. It doesn’t need to work for all possible inputs. Observe the examples carefully, imagine the grid
        visually, and try to find the pattern.
        ## Examples:
        ### Example 0:
        input = [[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4,5,4,4,0,0],

        [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]]
        output = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,4], [0,0,4,4], [0,0,3,3], [0,0,0,3], [0,3,3,3], [0,0,0,3], [0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0]]
        ### Example 1:

        [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]]
        output = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,2], [0,0,6,2], [0,0,0,2], [0,2,2,2], [0,0,6,6], [0,0,0,2], [0,2,2,2], [0,0,0,2],
        [0,0,0,0]]
        ### Example 2:
        input = [[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,7,0,0,0], [0,0,0,8,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,8,5,0,0,0,0],
        [0,7,8,8,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,8,8,0,0], [0,0,0,8,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,8,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,5,8,7,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]]
        output= [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,7], [0,0,0,8], [0,0,0,8], [0,7,8,8], [0,0,8,8], [0,0,0,8], [0,0,0,8], [0,0,7,8],
        [0,0,0,0]]
        ### Test Problem:
        input = [[0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1,5,1,0,0,0], [0,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,6],

        [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]]
        Analyze the transformation rules and Test Input and return the transformation function in the format:
```
def transform(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    # Your code here
    return transformed_grid

        ## An example question from GPQA:
        Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10-9 sec and 10-8 sec, respectively. We
        want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which one of the following options could be their
        energy difference so that they be clearly resolved?
        Answer choices:
        10-9 eV
        10-8 eV
        10-7 eV
        10-6 eV
        Correct answer [Not provided]:
        10-7 eV
        Explanation [Not provided]:
        According to the uncertainty principle, Delta E* Delta t=hbar/2. Delta t is the lifetime and Delta E is the
        width of the energy level. With Delta t=10-9 s==> Delta E1= 3.3 10-7 ev. And Delta t=10-11 s gives
        Delta E2=3.310-8 eV. Therefore, the energy difference between the two states must be significantly
        greater than 10-7 ev. So the answer is 10-4 ev
